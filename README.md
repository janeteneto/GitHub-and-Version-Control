# GitHub-and-version-control

- What is Git?
Git is a free and open-source version control system used to manage and track changes made to software code or any other type of files. It keeps track of changes made to files, allows multiple people to work on the same files, and helps manage different versions of files.

- What is a VCS (Version Control System)?
Version control is a system that helps keep track of changes made to files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same files without overwriting each other's work and enables users to revert to earlier versions of files. Git is an example of a VCS (Version Control System)

- What is GitHub and how does it differ from Git itself?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for working with Git repositories. It is basically a Git remote repository that allows users to store, manage, and collaborate on code, and provides features like issue tracking, project management, and code reviews.

- What are the main benefits of version control?
The main benefits of version control are that it allows multiple people to collaborate on the same files without overwriting each other's work, keeps track of changes made to files over time, and allows users to revert to earlier versions of files if necessary. 

- Some of the main Git commands are:

git init: Initialises a new Git repository in the current directory.
git add . : Adds files to the staging area so that they are ready to be committed.
git commit -m "message goes here" : Creates a new commit with the changes made to files in the staging area, along with a commit message describing the changes.
git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.
git pull: Downloads changes from a remote repository and incorporates them into the local repository.
git branch: Lists all branches in the repository, and allows you to create, rename, or delete branches.
git merge: Merges changes from one branch into another.

  Another relevant command that I fnd important is:
git status: Shows the current status of the Git repository, including which files are staged, modified, or untracked. This is helpful because it shows which files have been modified or added since the last commit, which files are currently staged and ready to be committed, and which files are not being tracked by Git.
